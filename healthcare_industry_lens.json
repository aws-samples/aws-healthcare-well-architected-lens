For example, if your account structure mirrors your software development lifecycle with accounts designated for development, testing, staging, and production, the production and staging accounts may be designated as  health data  accounts and are therefore documented as containing health data. Then, implement procedures and controls in the development and testing accounts to prevent health data from being stored there.\n\nYou can also assign tags to your AWS resources, which consist of a user-defined key and value. Tags help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. Create tags to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Use tags to help identify and document resources and objects that contain sensitive health data in accordance you re your data classification strategy. Do not store sensitive health data in tags, as they are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data. Finally, access to resources can be controlled through tags. ",

This verifies that all accounts within that OU are using a standardized set of policies and controls, which can help organizations align to their specific compliance needs.\n\nFurthermore, as outlined in the Organizing Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts whitepaper, when you limit sensitive data stores to an account that is built to manage it, you can more easily constrain the number of people and processes that can access and manage the data.
